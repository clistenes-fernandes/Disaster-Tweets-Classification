# Disaster-Tweets-Classification
## Classification of disaster tweets using Convolutional Neural Network and Recurrent Neural Network

This project was inspired by a Kaggle competition that asked the participants try to predict either a tweeter was real about a disaster or not. The platform provided the data for training and also the test data. 
So after sending the predictions of the model chosen by me to Kaggle I decided to post some result on Github by splitting the training dataset into train and test.

To complete this task wese used the model proposed by Wang et al. 2019, that used a Convolutional Neural Network and a LSTM Recurrent Neural Network to perform a classification task, the architecture of the model can be seen on figures below:

In this project was used the same CNN proposed on the paper but was used Gated Recurrent Unit - GRU as the recurrent layer instead of LSTM.
